                <h2>January's pick</h2>
                <p class="colonne1">Dear,</p>
                  <p class="colonne1">You were astoundingly <span class="shakes shake-chunk">beautiful</span> on that night. I’m so anxious for meeting you again that I can’t wait to share with you my remarks on your graduation ball, how <span class="shakes shake-chunk">beautiful</span>, <span class="shakes shake-chunk">heavenly</span> and <span class="shakes shake-chunk">sublime</span> you looked. You seemed to be <span class="shakes shake-chunk">floating</span> arond the hall while everyone else was tied to the ground, the orchestra particularly made for you.
                  When I got into the place I almost immediately saw you and I knew for sure what I was about to experience. What a <span class="shakes shake-chunk">gorgeous</span> woman I thought! That dress <span class="shakes shake-chunk">perfecly</span> surrounding your body and you dancing so <span class="shakes shake-chunk">gracefully</span> and <span class="shakes shake-chunk">beautifully</span> I thought that had to be one of the rarest of things I´d ever have the privilege to see in this life... Honestly, on that moment I lost my voice, there I was with my mouth open like an idiot watching your show...
                  When you gave me the opportunity to dance with you that waltz, I could hardly believe that that was really happening to me, it seemed there was no one but us dancing in the room, a true <span class="shakes shake-chunk">perfect</span> couple! It was <span class="shakes shake-chunk">thrilling</span> and <span class="shakes shake-chunk">exciting</span> what I felt that night. It was your <span class="shakes shake-chunk">princess</span> day and I was the luckiest vassal, the happiest man in the party.
                  Expressing myself in such a formal way, you may be not recognizing me. But it was your <span class="shakes shake-chunk">majestic</span> presence and not the suit and tie that transformed me in such a gentleman, the last <span class="shakes shake-chunk">romantic</span> guy in the world.

                  All right, I'm just prattling, that's all gibberish, it shouldn´t be this hard to tell you how much I <span class="shakes shake-chunk">love</span> you!</p>

Your eyes look as if they behold a <span class="shakes shake-slow">magic </span>power, because they <span class="shakes shake-slow">shine</span> like a cosmic ray that’s crossing the universe, capable of giving light to all the darkness in the universe. You know I’ve been meaning to tell you all this for a while now, but I was in doubt every time I stopped to think about how you could react, especially when I revealed my wish to look in your <span class="shakes shake-slow">lovely</span> eyes each time closer.

                  <p class="colonne4">If I were your <span class="shakes shake-rotate">boyfriend</span> I would be very <span class="shakes shake-rotate">happy</span> and <span class="shakes shake-rotate">proud</span> to have someone as <span class="shakes shake-rotate">special</span> as you by my side; and I think you would also be <span class="shakes shake-rotate">happy</span> to have someone as <span class="shakes shake-rotate">devoted</span> as me to 'pamper' you and give you <span class="shakes shake-rotate">presents</span> on the 14th of February... But I am not your <span class="shakes shake-rotate">boyfriend</span>... so much for taking you for a walk or lunch and maybe even dinner; the chances of inviting you on a <span class="shakes shake-rotate">date</span>, like having an <span class="shakes shake-rotate">ice cream</span>, followed by movies and popcorn are <span class="shakes shake-rotate">pretty</span> remote; and the opportunity to offer you this <span class="shakes shake-rotate">wonderful</span> perfume that someone has just tested on me is very slim. You know that I would never say or do something that might be misunderstood. Being someone`s <span class="shakes shake-rotate">girlfriend</span> or <span class="shakes shake-rotate">boyfriend</span> is very different from being just friends (although they may not always remain like that, right?) But, as I was saying, if I were your <span class="shakes shake-rotate">boyfriend</span> and you were my <span class="shakes shake-rotate">girlfriend</span>, I would <span class="shakes shake-rotate">invite</span> you to spend the weekend with me; we could go sailing on a boat of a friend of mine. Or maybe we could get one of those airline promotions and go to Rio de Janeiro, I heard it`s <span class="shakes shake-rotate">beautiful</span>! Yes... it`s a shame you are not my <span class="shakes shake-rotate">girlfriend</span>...But there is still some time till the 14th of February, right? Just give it a thought. I leave with a <span class="shakes shake-rotate">kiss</span> from your 'just' friend.</p>

                <p class="colonne5">For a <span class="shakes shake-vertical">nice</span> girl,</p>
                  <p class="colonne5">I thought it was really <span class="shakes shake-vertical">nice</span> of you to have given me your <span class="shakes shake-vertical">e-mail</span> so that I could send you a <span class="shakes shake-vertical">little message</span>. Besides, you are nothing but <span class="shakes shake-vertical">nice</span>...
    And although I know you so <span class="shakes shake-vertical">little</span> (after all, we only chatted that day), I`m not afraid to say that you are something else.
    I`m curious : you are <span class="shakes shake-vertical">nice</span>, <span class="shakes shake-vertical">intelligent</span>, <span class="shakes shake-vertical">educated</span> and <span class="shakes shake-vertical">elegant</span>, why did you also have to be this <span class="shakes shake-vertical">beautiful</span> ?
    What I`m about to say is not blasphemy. I respect all <span class="shakes shake-vertical">Godly</span> things but I believe that He had to sketch an entire human race before He drew you. And when He found the formula, in His loud and <span class="shakes shake-vertical">celestial</span> voice He said : “Speak!”
    And you did. And the most impressive bit of this story is that, since then, you`ve only spoken intelligent, <span class="shakes shake-vertical">charming </span>things. Look (name), I would like to see you again. And again and again. Soon. Call me or send me a reply.</p>

    I know that all tracks I walk by your side will be <span class="shakes shake-chunk">good</span> ones. I know that all steps I take next to you will be the right ones towards absolute <span class="shakes shake-chunk">happiness</span>. And that's because I can feel the strength of <span class="shakes shake-chunk">love</span>, decency, friendship, honesty and all the <span class="shakes shake-chunk">virtues</span> with a simple touch of your hand or when you look at me.
    You make me look at the future with the certainty that <span class="shakes shake-chunk">happiness</span> is possible and that we should not fear any obstacles. Because we will always find a way out of any difficulties if we keep our </span>hearts filled with this greater feeling called <span class="shakes shake-chunk">love</span>, a <span class="shakes shake-chunk">love</span> that means solidarity, companionship and <span class="shakes shake-chunk">faith</span> in life. You convince me of that. That and a lot more, because there’s nothing better in the world than to feel <span class="shakes shake-chunk">loved</span> and wanted...
    Take this letter as a confirmation of the immense <span class="shakes shake-chunk">love</span> I feel for you and for your <span class="shakes shake-chunk">noble spirit</span>, strength, feelings and <span class="shakes shake-chunk">beauty</span> that are kept in their essence. </p>

    <p class="colonne8">Sometimes I catch myself thinking of your smart talk, those genius hints on every subject that only you can come up with... Falling in love with you was not unjustified, you are a confident and intelligent man, you don't feed only on newspapers like most men nowadays.
    You have a remarkable personality, and your education clearly comes back then from the cradle. You also have a strong disposition that helps you to succeed in your undertakings. Your future life will never be a mere repetition of the pas. Your creativity doesn't rely only on things kept in memory.
    You don´t worry about keeping what you gain. You think that living the present is more important than saving for the future. You trust on what´s life has been keeping for you. You are certainly a differentiated person and I´m still in love with you for all of it.
    I believe you can make my dreams come true, ever since the day I met you you´ve been soothing my heart, even if you don´t recognize it... My heart pulses only for you, and this simple letter expresses my admiration and all those things that I haven´t had the courage to talk to you, but you better know it´s all where it should be: inside my heart. </p>
